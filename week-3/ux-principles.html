    <h1>Affordances, Amazon</h1>
    <p>Amazon.com has the perfect example of an affordance, which is to add items to the space where you can checkout, it is called a "cart". This word and image gives the user an easy way to understand what the functionality is, because they can relate it to a real world shopping cart.</p>

    <h2>Mapping, Google Maps</h2>
    <p>Google Maps has a prime example of mapping in its zoom in and zoom out functionality. The user can either use the buttons purposefully off the side in order to zoom. Or more likely they have a mouse or trackpad, which the user naturally knows to scroll up for zoom in, or scroll down for zoom out.</p>

    <h3>Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Google</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the easiest example of great signal to noise ratio is the classic google search bar. There is only one obvious thing to do on this screen, and that is to use that search bar dead in the center. There is nothing to distract a user from the simple search bar.</p>

    <h4>Hick's Law, Airbnb</h4>
    <p>Right when you go on airbnb.com, you are greeted at the top of the screen 3 options to use the search functionality of the website. Simply enter where you want to go, when you want to go, and with how many people. It's as easy as that, this makes the user think only a little bit, and not get bogged down in all the details of traveling.</p>

    <h5>Ockham's Razor</h5>
    <p>There is a reason reddit.com has such a immense following and has been around for so long, and it isn't because it's pretty. When you go on reddit, you are shown "The front page of the Internet" as they claim -- which is basically a list of the links you need with titles and a small picture. I am sure there were design decisions tossed out the window after all these years that try and make it pretty by hiding some things behind other UI elements. But the beauty of reddit is that it is not convoluted at all. You click a link, see the full content, and go back to the homepage.</p>
