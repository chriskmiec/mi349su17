If I had to choose between doing style tiles or full on mockups for early design
iterations I would probably go with style tiles. I feel like there is so much
value in trying out many different combinations of color and form. Especially
since in the real world most of us are designing for clients, and not for personal
gain. Because of this, it would be a waste of time to go all in on one design only
to have a client reject it. This is a form of user-centered design, which I am
a hardcore advocate of. You never know what the right answer to a question is
by yourself, you must always get input from the end user.
